**_Can we rethink the Welfare State? Is there a
genuine third-way using Hindu principles?_**

Arguably,
nations are searching for alternative answers when considering how wealth
should be

redistributed in society.
Russia and Cuba are recovering from an exit of socialism while Singapore, Hong
Kong and the UAE are growing rapidly using creative capitalist models. The
United Kingdom struggled under left-wing socialism in the 1960s and remains
caught between utilising the welfare state or completely freeing society from
the shackles of government. Young emerging economies such as Brazil and India
are searching for creative ideas. The needs, however, are universal: (a) to
incentivise entrepreneurs and produce a productive workforce that is no longer
dependent on state income; (b) to protect the most vulnerable in our society;
and (c) to ensure that there are sufficient funds in times of crisis. This
article argues how dharmic principles can assist in formulating a more
sustainable "third-way" model to meet our social and economic needs. 

Vichaar Manthan
(the "Churning of Thoughts") discussed this very issue at the Houses
of Parliament on 9th September 2015 in front of honourable MP's, Peers and
Dignitaries. The discussion involved Dr Sachin ji Nandha, Bob Blackman MP and
Professor Satish ji Modh, who streamed live via video link from Mumbai. This
article utilises the thoughts and discussions during this event.

**The "Facts"**

Welfare is
defined as social protection and doesn't include state pension. Welfare has
accounted for 15% of total government spending this year (down from 18%) so 15%
of £750 billion is welfare. State pension was 20%. The largest section of 8% of
welfare is towards "Social Protection", which includes child tax credits,
social services, care, etc. Unemployment benefits make up 0.5% of total
government spending. Our total tax revenues for this year were circa £650
billion. So we are £100 billion in the red. We are already as a country, 80%
leveraged. In other words, our entire GDP is worth about £1.8 trillion but our
total debt is about £1.5 trillion and if we keep going down this road, what
will our lenders say? "No more". At that stage, what do we do?

**Employment and Enterprise v State Benefits (the
"productive" function)**

There is a
distinct synergy between Pranayam and Arthayam. In Pranayam, we take a breath,
hold it and release it. However, we only breathe whatever is needed to sustain
and release the remaining breath back in the atmosphere. Arguably, the state
should adopt its fiscal policy in the same manner - spend only what is required
to sustain. This would allow the state to focus on real governance to create a
prosperous society that is producing surplus wealth. 

This surplus
wealth can be an accumulation of surplus wealth generated by every family. When
every family generates surplus wealth, the state has more money in its hand and
the wealth of the nation increases.

If you look at
the whole journey from individual to family, to society and to the government,
in this whole journey, if the government is focusing purely on individuals and
not looking at the society and the family then there is a missing link between
the funds of government and its individuals.

There is no
doubt that the concept of "welfare" is a testament to our
civilisation. Morally, it is already a form of "Sewa" (selfless
service), which is a key concept of dharma. However, in dharma, the charity
concept is described in 3 parts or manners as Satvik charity, Rajasik charity,
and Tamsic charity. 

The Satvik
charity is the one which is given to the deserving and when the person needs
it. 

Rajasik charity
is given for popularity, for the sake of getting popularity and praise.

And Tamsic
charity is given to those who don't deserve it.

So, when we are
performing the acts of charity, our focus has to be on Satvik charity.

When the
government has got funds in hand, it has to eliminate charity for popularity.
It also has to identify people who don't need charity.

Once we
eliminate Rajasik and Tamsic charity, there will be more funds available from
the government to distribute it to those people who actually deserve it. 

That process in
the Hindu philosophy is called "Antyodaya". The government has to focus on that
segment of people who really need it.

Coming back to
the role of government, how do you create a prosperous society? A prosperous
society is built through those actions that create surplus wealth.

How do we create
surplus wealth? We earn money. When we talk about Pranayam and Arthayam, the
process of breathing in is the process of earning money.

Every one of us
earns money and from that money, some part of it is collected through tax by
the government.

Those taxes
become the money which is earned by the government. Now some part of that money
is consumed by us and the remaining money which we do not consume becomes
wealth. We use that money for investment and industry.

Hindu philosophy
states that if you want to create a prosperous society, the policies of the
government has to disperse to create opportunities for 100 productive hands to
1\.

Once you provide
entrepreneurial opportunities from 100 hands, it should create sufficient
opportunities to be distributed by 1000 hands. If the money is used in a manner
that people in the society and in the family who have enough opportunities to
earn money and create surplus wealth for youngsters, they will in return be
able to create surplus wealth for the government.

The ratio of
distribution of wealth between various activities of the government will be
decided by the issues of that time.

If there are
more people during an economic downturn who need help, the government should
have enough wealth to take care of those people during those difficult times.

Let's turn to Dharmanomics,
which could replace the concept of capitalism and socialism. Capitalism has been
the beacon of enterprise, creating innovation within the society and using
surplus wealth to help capitalism. In socialism, money has actively been
converted to welfare for the people with little benefit to a progressive and
developing society, and a lost focus on those productive hands that can earn
money for the state.

Policies of the
government have to provide opportunities for entrepreneurs, those who want to
work, to give them easy funds so that they are not looking for employment, but instead
generating employment for others.

Surplus wealth
can never be created by looking for employment. It is always generated by
generating more employment. 

The task,
therefore, is to shift from an "Employment Generation" to an "Enterprising and
Self-Sustaining Generation". It's not the government's task to generate
employment through policies but rather an individual's offering, her "sewa, to
ensure that her business is productive through the power of her employees.

**Protecting the most vulnerable (the
"paternal" function)**

When the
government is spending over £60 billion just on helping people through social
services, child tax credits, and social care for the aged, the state has
effectively taken over the role of looking after a certain segment of society.
The crucial question is whether or not it is the state's responsibility to take
care of this segment of society? 

A paternalism
approach involves the state taking on the responsibility that once belonged to
the family, to the individual of the family, to the community and society. As the
vacuum of state fatherhood has grown, our bills have become bigger and bigger.

However, it is
correct to say that if you eradicate welfare over a five year period and rightfully
use it to balance the books, you will get greater inequality, even less social
mobility than we have now and the most vulnerable becoming even more
disadvantaged. 

What we need to
do instead is to empower individuals to take responsibility for the whole of
our society and then gradually reduce welfare. So as a collective consciousness
grows from our education system and through carefully constructed programmes, a
collective consciousness will replace the state's responsibility. 

This means
taking care of your grandmother and housing her when housing is required (Maatra
Devo Bhaava, Pitru Devo Bhaava). This means picking up a brush and swiping the
dust and dirt of our roads. This means spending one hour per week utilising
your experience and skills to volunteer. This would be a society that is not
heavily reliant but instead self-sustaining.

Through a
greater emphasis and reliance on welfare, and rather than supporting those who
can create wealth, we are actively converting productive money into
unproductive money.

Somewhere, the
balance has to be made between distributing wealth to poorer sections of the
society and those sections that can actually work for the generation of wealth.

Until and unless
we focus on that, the concept of the welfare state will inevitably come to a
standstill. 

To summarize, Dharmanomics
from Pranayam to Arthayam, as oxygen is necessary for the sustenance of our
life, similarly, money or wealth is necessary for the sustenance of society.
The policy of the state has to be such that the entrepreneurial potential of
productive people should always be well nurtured and supported, particularly when
they are in a position to generate wealth and the idea is that we will have
surplus wealth that will mean more funds being available to take care of the
poorer section of the society.

**Defence and Preventative Measures (the
"preventive" function)**

In order to
strike a desirable balance between providing welfare for the genuinely
vulnerable segments of our society and progress to a wealthy and more independently
sustainable nation, regulation holds the key to ensure that this balance is
well-preserved. Our education system must teach the benefits of a moral and
compassionate society. It must teach the power of a higher consciousness, to
protect the elderly without over-draining the state's resources. At the same
time, checks and balances must be put in place to ensure that individuals are
not cheating society, that individuals and corporates are paying their taxes at
the required level or that junior doctors are well-supported and financed to
perform vital roles. 

A genuine
third-way is possible using Hindu principles and could be a way forward from
the ideals of capitalism and socialism that have governed society for years.
